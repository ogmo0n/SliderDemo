Slider Frame: a Java Swing/Java AWT exercise.

In this exercise, I was tasked with creating a JFrame that contained a JSlider to
adjust the size of a circle. Additionally, I added radio buttons to change the shape
from a circle to a square, change the background color, and/or change the foreground
color to either red, blue, or green.

I am proud of the work I put into this particular assignment as it was quite challenging.
